## Inverse Reinforcement Learning
[*ICML '19*](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/shah19a.html), BAIR, @rohinmshah

Rohin M Shah and I worked on this together, starting in 2017. 
Rohin was an excellent mentor and human being to do research with.

# Non-conventional research

Tony Beltramelli was kind enough to allow mentor a bunch of young undergrads who wanted to toy with his Pix2Code paper.
I led a team of a few other undergraduates associated with the Statistics Undergrad Student Association on this project.
