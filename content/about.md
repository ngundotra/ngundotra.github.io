I work full-time for Goldman Sachs as a quant, on the One Delta Equities team. 
In December 2020, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a double degree in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics.


### My Interests
1. Automated Theorem Proving Assistants
2. Wim Hof Method
3. Fasting

- Evidence that helps shrink tumors because it starves fermentation-based cancer cells of free floating glucose (idk, see Metabolic Theory of Cancer)

4. Manifolds

- To finish my calculus tutelage, duh!

5. Algebraic Topology 

- Formalisms too difficult for me to bite without tasting rind of the matter, so that's why I'm working on IDE for math. Classic mathematician thinking... can't solve specific case so I'll work on general version ðŸ˜‚

6. Manifesting

7. Lo-fi music
